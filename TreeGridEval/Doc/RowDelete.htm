<h1>Row deleting</h1>
<p>TreeGrid documentation</p>

When a user deletes row, the row is <u>not</u> physically removed. The deleted row is marked as <a href="#IDeleted">Deleted</a> and is hidden or colored red depending on <a href="#CfgShowDeleted">ShowDeleted</a>.<br />
The deleted row can be still undeleted, by a user if it is visible or by API.<br /> 
After the changes are uploaded to server and server accepts the changes, the deleted row is physically removed from grid and its data.<br />
